## 3. Building a unique VR experience
Unity stands out as a powerful platform for VR development, offering a wide range of tools and features that facilitate the creation of immersive VR environments. This section will equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to leverage Unity's capabilities to their fullest, ensuring that your ICVR project meets expectations in terms of quality and uniqueness. 

<br clear>


### 3.1	Build a VR space using ICVR pre-made scenes and prefabs
In this video tutorial, you'll discover how to quickly construct a basic VR scene by leveraging ICVR's pre-designed scenes and prefabs. The process is straightforward:
- Visit 👉 https://github.com/ICVRhub/ICVR_Framework , navigate to "Releases", download "source_code.zip" and extract the content of the zip file (unless you've already performed these steps previously).
- Go back to your Unity project, click “Assets”, then "Import Package", and select "Custom Package".
- Import "ICVR_DLC" package.
- Import a pre-made ICVR scene, which forms the backbone of your VR environment.
- Use the ICVR prefabs by simply dragging and dropping them into your scene.

This approach allows for quick asset placement and scene assembly and will help you to understand the fundamentals of building VR environments in Unity.

### 4.3	Set up the Internet Identity and cycles wallet canister in DFX
In order to deploy your VR experience on the live ICP network we have to perform the following steps first:
- set up an Internet Identity in DFX.
- send 1 ICP to the DFX Internet Identity account ID.
- create the cycles wallet canister with at least 6.3 TC (trillion cycles) which would cost ~0.7 ICP.

#### 📺 Video tutorial 👉 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDvXqMdmWTY
#### 📝 Written Tutorial 👇
1.	Create a new Internet Identity in DFX (replace “icvr” with your own name) by entering the following command in your terminal :
```bash
dfx identity new icvr
```

2.	Save your seed phrase in a safe place.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/RMNI531.png">

3.	Activate your new Internet Identity by entering the command:
```bash
dfx identity use icvr
``` 


4.	To verify the use of your new Identity, enter the following command:
```bash
dfx identity list
```
5. You should see a list of all Identities, the one with a star is the one currently in use.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cbh5IjS.png">

6.	Get the account ID(wallet address) for your Identity by entering the following command:
```bash
dfx ledger account-id
```
7. This long number is your account ID (wallet address).

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pTe6sCQ.png">

8.	Send 1 ICP token to your wallet address.
9.	To verify your ICP balance enter the following command:
```bash
dfx ledger --network ic balance
```
10. You should have received 1 ICP minus transaction fee.

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/40wl5dN.png">

11.	Retrieve the principal for your Identity by entering the following command:
```bash
dfx identity get-principal
```
12.	Create a canister with 0.7 ICP with the following command:
```bash
dfx ledger --network ic create-canister “your principal” --amount 0.7
```
13. The last line shows your canister ID

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LuurkfW.png">

14.	Create a wallet canister with a following command:
```bash
dfx identity --network ic deploy-wallet “your canister ID”
```
15.	Run the following command to check the cycles balance of your canister:
```bash
dfx wallet --network ic balance
```
16. You shoud see that your canister is now charged with ~6.3 TC (trillion cycles):

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/COlSREx.png">

17.	To add more cycles (specify the amount in ICP, it doesn’t need to be 0.3) you can run the following command:
```bash
dfx ledger –-network ic top-up --amount 0.3 “your canister ID”
```
